# 📚 Library Management System(Book-nest)

Welcome to the **Library Management System** — a complete backend solution built using **Spring Boot** to manage books, authors, students, and transactions.  
Includes a custom **frontend UI** to visualize the project directory and source code with an interactive file viewer.

---

## 📖 Project Description

**Library Management System** is a full-stack backend application developed using **Spring Boot**, designed to manage and streamline typical operations within a library — including book management, author registration, student enrollment, library card control, and book issuance/return through a transaction system.

It follows a clean **MVC architecture** and uses **RESTful APIs** for interaction. To make the project structure visually appealing and easy to navigate.

This project is perfect for:
- Learning how Spring Boot applications are structured.
- Understanding layered architecture in Java projects.
- Demonstrating skills in backend API development and code organization.
- Showcasing a creative UI approach for backend projects.
